Install
=======
Let assume you will call your grid "alpha". 

cd $HOME/tmp      # or somewhere like src/
git clone [repo]
cd ./dgrid-devel/init
./initgrid.sh name=alpha dest=$HOME

This will install first node of new grid into your $HOME directory. First part 
of installation log will be in $HOME (in case if something go very wrong) , and
second part(plus copy of first part) will be in $HOME/alpha/
